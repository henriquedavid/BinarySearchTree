# Binary Search Tree

Development by Abra√£o Vitor and Henrique David.

Language: JAVA

To run the code on this repository it's necessary to install the Java JDK, on this [link](https://www.java.com/inc/BrowserRedirect1.jsp?locale=pt_BR). After downloaded, you can install Netbeans/Eclipse or use the linux terminal. On IDE you can add the code to the platform and play run and that's it. If you are using the terminal you can use the follow code (on the project path):

```$ javac Main.java```

```$ java Main```

Observe that to run the commands and load a specific tree you need to edit the files "arquivo de comandos.txt" with the commands and "arquivo de entrada da ABB.txt" with the tree. So you can run the code.
